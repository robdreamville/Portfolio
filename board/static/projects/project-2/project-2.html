    <span>This is a Music Recommendation app I created using flask and the spotify api</span>

    <span class="lb">JbTunez lets you pick a mood and top genres, from there it generates top artists based on the genres selected. After you select some
        to artist to enhance the recommendation and viola, you get spotify links to go listen to your recommendations
    </span>

    <span class="lb">I made this because I love music and wanted to do something I enjoy.
